# Google Package for FuelPHP - with OAuth2 support

This package provides support for the Google APIs using OAuth2 tokens.
It does _not_ provide an authorisation mechanism, for that, we recommend fuel-packages/fuel-oauth2 (or happyninjas/fuel-ninjauth).

Please feel free to pull-request additional APIs, we'll only be adding them if we need them/are paid to add them ;)

## Dependencies

This package requires fuel-packages/fuel-oauth2 in order to refresh access tokens when they expire.

## Usage

This package follows standard installation rules, which can be found within the [FuelPHP Documentation for Packages] (http://fuelphp.com/docs/general/packages.html)
